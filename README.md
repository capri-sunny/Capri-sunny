## Hi there!

my preferred name is Capri!

I am currently learning Python using Codédex. 📖
I was a complete beginner, started 16 April 2025, and I'm already on the Loops chapter! 👏
If anybody has tips about coding (specifically Python), please tell me! 🤔
Ask me about the basics really, such as loops, variables, if, elif and else! (yes, a beginner) 🙃
Reach me through Discord : Capri.Sunny.
